# Agent Skills & AI Integration

Using **Claude Code**, **Cursor**, **Codex**, **OpenCode**, or another AI coding assistant? You can integrate ARCaptcha bot protection into your application automatically without writing repetitive boilerplate code.

ARCaptcha provides standardized, machine-readable specifications that enable autonomous agents to configure client-side widget embedding, server-side challenge verification, and official SDKs with zero guesswork.

---

## 1-Click Agent Prompt

To turn your AI coding assistant into an ARCaptcha integration expert, copy and paste this prompt into your agent session:

```text
Please read https://docs.arcaptcha.co/onboard.md and help me integrate ARCaptcha into this project.
```

This single command directs your agent to our comprehensive, machine-readable [onboard.md](https://docs.arcaptcha.co/onboard.md) specification, containing all frontend requirements, backend verification endpoints, official SDK references, and security rules.

## Supported AI Assistants

### Claude Code
Run Claude Code in your terminal and pass the prompt directly:
```bash
claude "Please read https://docs.arcaptcha.co/onboard.md and help me integrate ARCaptcha into this project."
```
You can also launch Claude Code directly from the **Add to your Agent** sidebar widget on any documentation page using the `claude-cli://` protocol.

### Cursor
Add ARCaptcha integration instructions to your project in Cursor:
1. Open **Cursor Chat** (`Ctrl+L` / `Cmd+L`) or **Composer** (`Ctrl+I` / `Cmd+I`) and paste the prompt.
2. Or trigger it directly as a prompt using the **Cursor** button in the documentation sidebar (`https://cursor.com/link/prompt`).
3. You can also persist it in your repository's `.cursorrules` file by referencing `https://docs.arcaptcha.co/onboard.md`.

### Codex
Start a new task in Codex with the onboarding prompt:
```text
Please read https://docs.arcaptcha.co/onboard.md and help me integrate ARCaptcha into this project.
```
Or click the **Codex** button in our desktop documentation sidebar to launch a session in the Codex CLI via `codex-cli://open`.

### OpenCode
In OpenCode, launch a new session via the **OpenCode** button in our documentation sidebar (`opencode://open`), which automatically copies the onboarding prompt to your clipboard.

## Security Architecture & Best Practices

ARCaptcha employs a strict two-key security model. When prompting your agent, enforce key separation:

| Key | Environment | Placement | Security Rule |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Site Key** (`site_key`) | Public (Client-Side) | HTML container attribute `data-site-key`, SDK config | Safe to share with your agent and commit to frontend markup or client configs. |
| **Secret Key** (`secret_key`) | Private (Server-Side) | Server environment variables (e.g. `ARCAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY`) | **CRITICAL**: Never expose the Secret Key in client-side code, git commits, or frontend bundles. Instruct your agent to read it only from backend environment variables. |

:::caution Protect Your Secret Key
Never allow an AI assistant to paste your `secret_key` into client-side JavaScript or HTML templates. The Secret Key must only be accessed by trusted backend servers calling `https://api.arcaptcha.co/arcaptcha/api/verify`.
:::

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Get Credentials**: Retrieve your **Site Key** and **Secret Key** from the [ARCaptcha Dashboard](https://dashboard.arcaptcha.co/log-in).
2. **Configure Environment**: Add your `secret_key` to your backend `.env` file (e.g. `ARCAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key`).
3. **Prompt Your Agent**: Specify the exact form or endpoint you wish to protect:
   ```text
   Please read https://docs.arcaptcha.co/onboard.md and add ARCaptcha protection to my login form at /login and verify the token on the server.
   ```
4. **Agent Performs Integration**:
   - Injects the script: `https://nwidget.arcaptcha.ir/1/api.js` (or installs the official framework SDK).
   - Mounts the `<div class="arcaptcha" data-site-key="YOUR_SITE_KEY"></div>` container inside the target form.
   - Extracts the submitted `arcaptcha-token` in your backend route.
   - Verifies the token against `https://api.arcaptcha.co/arcaptcha/api/verify` before executing sensitive business logic.
